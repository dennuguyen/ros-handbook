# ROS Description Package

## Learning Outcomes

- Can export STL meshes from a CAD.
- Can create a robot model using STL meshes with a descriptive language i.e. urdf, xacro, sdf.
- Can use mimic_joint and gazebo_ros_control plugins.
- Can write launch files for description packages.
- Can write rviz file.

## Exporting CAD as STL

Standard Triangle Language (STL) files are triangulated representations of a 3D CAD model.

When exporting a CAD as STL, consider what group of components do not need to be modelled separately. Typically, this group of components have fixed joints between themselves.

## Robot Description Languages

URDF, xacro, SDF.

## ROS Launch Files for Description Packages

## RViz
